A module to display [ThumbHash](https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/) using [Expo module](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/overview/).

*(If you want to use this library in a React-Native app,
you'll first need to [install expo modules](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/)).
That's why this project name is expo-thumbhash and not react-native-thumbhash)*

> Please be mindful that this project is an endeavor to understand the workings of expo-module.
> Its aim is
> to extend the same features as provided by [react-native-blurhash](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-blurhash).
> If you need this library or a specific feature, PR are welcomed.
